# Quantum
A software for Android that emulates the actions of a quantum computer

> It's main purpose is to enable testing to everyone, even on the go. 
> Since this app is only an emulator, it can show the position of the qubits on the bloch sphere.
> This app will also show the matrix and vector representations of the states and operators in a straightforward way.
> The limit is only the computing power of your device!

### Main features

- At most 6 qubits
- Gates with at most 4 qubits
- Parallel processing (1-64 threads)
- Extremely high number of shots (up to 2^19)
- Lots of predefined gates
- Get results immediately
- Show bloch sphere

### Predefined Gates
##### Single Qubit
- Hadamard
- Pauli-X/Y/Z
- S-gate (π/2 phase shift)
- T-gate (π/4 phase shift)
- π/6 phase shift
- √NOT
- Identity

##### Multi Qubit
- CNOT
- SWAP
- Toffoli
- Fredkin
- 2 & 3 Qubit Identity

###### Planned features
