A software for Android devices that emulates the actions of a quantum computer

> It's main purpose is to enable testing to everyone, even on the go. 
> Since this app is only an emulator, it can show the position of the qubits on the bloch sphere.
> This app will also show the matrix and vector representations of the states and operators in a straightforward way.
> The limit is only the computing power of your device!
