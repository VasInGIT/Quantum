        </h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Quantum Computing for Android (aka this app) emulates (almost) the lowest level of a
            quantum computer, i.e. logic gates. These are also the basic components of classical
            computers, however, in quantum computers logic gates work somewhat differently, which
            you can read about more in detail in the next part.
            <br />
            To place a logic gate in the app, first click somewhere on the screen. In the appeared
            window, you can select a gate and modify its properties. For example, its place or in
            case of a rotation or U3 gate, the angle of the rotations.
            <br />
            If you are done placing gates, you can execute the circuit, which may take a while if
            you placed many of them.
            <i>It is worth taking a quick tour in the settings menu, to see what options are
                available.
            </i>
            <br />
            If you wish to change the order of the gates, or if you want to replace them with a
            different one, simply click on the gate, and select the desired option in the dialog
            that opened.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            You can also save the circuit you have created, but before you need to select a folder
            for saving, in the settings. This directory will also be used to save any gates you have
            created yourself in the gate editor. To open a file, click the folder icon on the bottom
            left corner of the main screen and select the desired file. The app currently only
            supports its own file format, which are
            <b>.qsf</b>
            (new) and
            <b>.viqus</b>
            (old) files.
        </p>
        <h4

            <strong>Quantum Logic Gates</strong>
        </h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Quantum logic gates (QLGs) &ndash; similarly to classical logic gates &ndash; perform
            some operation on one or more qubits that changes their value. These logic gates can
            be divided into two main groups,
            based on how many qubits are involved in the operation. An important property of QLGs
            is that they are reversible, which means that no information is lost when we use them.
            From this, it follows that they have an equal number of inputs and outputs.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            In order to use these gates on your virtual qubits
            in this app, you need to choose first a gate then select which qubits should be affected
            by it.
            <br />
            In addition to predefined gates, the app includes two types of customizable gates, one
            of them being the
            Rotation gate, while the other is the U3 gate. The latter is really important, as all
            other single qubit gates
            are basically just a variant of U3.
            <br />
            Please note that for now, these gates are ideal, in contrast with real quantum gates
            that have some noise (a certain probability that they will
            <i>not</i>
            work as intended).
        </p>
        <p
                style="font-size:18px"
                id="rotation"

            <i>Rotation Gates</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Rotation gates as their name suggests, rotate the state-vector of the selected qubit
            along a selected axis.
            Using the standard parametrization of the sphere, we can easily describe these
            operations. Let's denote &theta; the angle of rotation around the X-axis of the bloch
            sphere, and &phi; the angle of rotation around the Z-axis, where &theta;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;&pi;]
            and &phi;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;2&pi;[. The rotation around the Z-axis is also
            called phase-shift. When you create a rotation gate using the
            app, always the rotation around the X-axis will be performed first, followed by the
            rotation around the Z-axis.

            The U3 gate is a unitary gate that has three parameters, hence its name.

            <strong>Hadamard</strong>
            <br />The Hadamard gate rotates the qubit along the xz&#8209;axis. This gate brings the
            qubit
            into a superposition of 0 and 1.

        <p>&lt;Hmatrix&gt;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Pauli gates</strong>
            <br />The Pauli gates rotate the qubit along the corresponding axes (X, Y, and Z).
            The Pauli&#8209;X gate is also called NOT.

            <strong>S and T (phase-shift) gates</strong>
            <br />These gates change the phase of the qubits (along the Z axis). The S gate is a
            &pi;/2
            phase-shift and the T is a &pi;/4 phase-shift. In order to make use of them, the qubit
            has to be in a superposition of 0 and 1. In a pure 0 or 1 state, phase-shift has no
            effect.

            <strong>&radic;NOT</strong>
            <br />Similarly to the Hadamard gate, the square root of the NOT gate brings the qubit
            into a superposition of 0 and 1 states, however, with a phase shift of -&pi;/2.
            Two &radic;NOT gates following each other equal to a Pauli&#8209;X gate, hence its name.
            This gate is equal to a rotation gate where &theta;&equals;&pi;/2 &amp; &phi;&equals;0.

            <i>Multi Qubit Gates</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Multi qubit gates act on a pair or more qubits, and usually they have one or more
            control and target qubits. A control qubit influences how the gate will act on the
            target
            qubit. Sometimes, however, both qubits are equal, eg. in the SWAP gate.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>CNOT</strong>
            <br />It is perhaps the most important gate in working with entanglement on quantum
            computers. To put things simple, it basically rotates the target qubit around its x-axis
            if
            the control qubit is measured 1 right after the application of the gate. It is a
            controlled
            Pauli&#8209;X gate.
        </p>
        <p>&lt;CNOTmatrix&gt;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Controlled Y</strong>
            <br />Similarly to CNOT, it performs a rotation if the control qubit is measured 1,
            however,
            around the y-axis. This gate is also a controlled Pauli gate.

            <strong>Controlled Z
                <br />
            </strong>
            As the above two gates, this gate performs a rotation along the Z-axis if the control
            qubit
            is measured 1. Besides being a controlled Pauli gate, this is also a controlled
            phase-shift

            Controlled S gate performs a relative phase shift of&nbsp;&pi;/2 between the two qubits
            if

            Controlled T gate performs a relative phase shift of&nbsp;&pi;/4 between the two qubits

            gate, it will leave a remark in the QASM file. Single-qubit user-defined gates will be
            converted into U3 when saving. Some special gates may also be converted into a
