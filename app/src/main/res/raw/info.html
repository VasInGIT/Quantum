        <h4>
            <strong>Quantum Logic Gates</strong>
        </h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Quantum logic gates (QLGs) &ndash; similarly to classical logic gates &ndash; perform
            some operation on one or more qubits that changes their value. These logic gates can
            be divided into two main groups,
            based on how many qubits are involved in the operation. An important property of QLGs
            is that they are reversible, which means that no information is lost when we use them.
            From this, it follows that they have an equal number of inputs and outputs.
            <br />
            In order to use these gates on your virtual qubits
            in this app, you need to choose first a gate then select which qubits should be affected
            by it.
            <br />
            Please note that for now, these gates are ideal, in contrast with real quantum gates
            that have some noise (a certain probability that they will
            <i>not</i>
            work as intended).
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:18px">
            <i>Rotation Gates</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Rotation gates as their name suggests, rotate the state-vector of the selected qubit
            along a selected axis.
            Using the standard parametrization of the sphere, we can easily describe these
            operations. Let's denote &theta; the angle of rotation around the X-axis of the bloch
            sphere, and &phi; the angle of rotation around the Z-axis, where &theta;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;&pi;]
            and &phi;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;2&pi;[. The rotation around the Z-axis is also
            called phase-shift. When you create a rotation gate using the
            app, always the rotation around the X-axis will be performed followed by the rotation
            around the Z-axis.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Hadamard</strong>
            <br />The Hadamard gate rotates the qubit along the xy&#8209;axis. This gate brings the
            qubit
            into a superposition of 0 and 1.
        </p>
        <p>&lt;Hmatrix&gt;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Pauli gates</strong>
            <br />The Pauli gates rotate the qubit along the corresponding axes (X, Y, and Z).
            The Pauli&#8209;X gate is also called NOT.

        <p>&lt;Zmatrix&gt;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>S and T (phase-shift) gates</strong>
            <br />These gates change the phase of the qubits (along the Z axis). The S gate is a
            &pi;/2
            phase-shift and the T is a &pi;/4 phase-shift. In order to make use of them, the qubit
            has to be in a superposition of 0 and 1. In a pure 0 or 1 state, phase-shift has no
            effect.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>&radic;NOT</strong>
            <br />Similarly to the Hadamard gate, the square root of the NOT gate brings the qubit
            into
            a superposition of 0 and 1 states, however, with a phase shift of -&pi;/2. Two &radic;NOT
            gates
            following each other equal to a Pauli&#8209;X gate, hence its name.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Identity</strong>
            <br />The identity matrix keeps the qubit in its current state (i.e does nothing).

            <i>Multi Qubit Gates</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Multi qubit gates act on a pair or more qubits, and usually they have one or more
            control and target qubits. A control qubit influences how the gate will act on the
            target
            qubit. Sometimes, however, both qubits are equal, eg. in the SWAP gate.
            <br />

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>CNOT</strong>
            <br />It is perhaps the most important gate in working with entanglement on quantum
            computers. To put things simple, it basically rotates the target qubit around its x-axis
            if
            the control qubit is measured 1 right after the application of the gate. It is a
            controlled
            Pauli&#8209;X gate.
        </p>
        <p>&lt;CNOTmatrix&gt;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Controlled Y</strong>
            <br />Similarly to CNOT, it performs a rotation if the control qubit is measured 1,
            however,
            around the y-axis. This gate is also a controlled Pauli gate.

            <strong>Controlled Z
                <br />
            </strong>
            As the above two gates, this gate performs a rotation along the Z-axis if the control
            qubit
            is measured 1. Besides being a controlled Pauli gate, this is also a controlled
            phase-shift
            gate with an angle&nbsp;&pi;.

            <strong>Controlled S
                <br />
            </strong>
            Controlled S gate performs a relative phase shift of&nbsp;&pi;/2 between the two qubits
            if
            the control qubit is&nbsp;1.

            <strong>Controlled T
                <br />
            </strong>
            Controlled T gate performs a relative phase shift of&nbsp;&pi;/4 between the two qubits
            if
            the
            control qubit is&nbsp;1.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <strong>Toffoli</strong>
            <br />The most common 3 qubit gate performs a NOT operation on the target qubit if both
            control qubits are measured&nbsp;1.
